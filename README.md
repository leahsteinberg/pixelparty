# This is Pixel Party
## not a game, a diversion.
Draw a doodle that you control as little red dots come flying at you. Press space bar to turn your doodle into a square and press space bar again to get your original doodle back.
Throw the doodle into the wall to compact it down. Then when it hits a red dot, it'll explode. The red dots deform the doodle, but if it ever gets too far apart, the doodle will automatically get home.

I wrote this as I was learning Javascript. All of the animation is done from scratch using HTML 5 canvas

#### It is simple but addictive.
